# ResNet Implementation in Java

This README provides a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the implementation of a simple ResNet-like neural network in Java. The code includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation, residual blocks, global average pooling, and a fully connected layer with softmax activation. Let's go through the key components and their workings step-by-step.

## Introduction
The `ResNet` class implements a simplified version of a ResNet-like architecture. ResNet (Residual Networks) are a type of deep neural network that utilize residual blocks to allow gradients to flow more easily through the network during training. This implementation covers the basic building blocks required to create a functioning ResNet model.

## Convolutional Layer
The `convolution2d` method performs a 2D convolution operation on the input tensor.

```java
public static double[][][] convolution2d(double[][][] inputTensor, int filters, int[] kernelSize, int[] strides, String padding) {
    // Initialize dimensions and padding
    // Perform padding if required
    // Compute output dimensions
    // Initialize output tensor
    // Perform convolution operation using random filter values
    return outputTensor;
}
